<h1>Use Case 2: Timelapse Features</h1>

An object of any class can be tracked over time. 
The features of these objects may be extracted at each timepoint, these are referrred to here as nodes.
The link between two nodes describes an edge. 
Each edge has two parents. Parent A is a node with time (T) and Parent B is a node with time (T + n). This means that the edge is directional. 
Edge features are the change over time of the node features. 
Multiple edges and nodes can be aggregated into tracks.
